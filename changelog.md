# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
- Custom GRUB bootloader theme
- Custom KDE splash screen
- Custom Raptor OS logo
- KDE theme fix (ongoing)

## [v2.3] - 2026-05-08 (Build System Major Fix 2 from v2.1)

### Fixed
- **Critical:** `recipe.yml` YAML parse failure — `- type: rpm-ostree` module entry was
  at column 1 instead of indented under `modules:`, causing the entire build to fail
  validation before any package installation
- **Critical:** `raptor-performance.sh` line 153 crash — `cat` attempted to write
  `/etc/raptor/thermal-idle.conf` before `mkdir -p /etc/raptor` was called; directory
  creation moved above the write
- **Critical:** `raptor-cpugovernor.service` systemd unit parse failure — multiline
  bash inside `ExecStart=` was being interpreted as invalid section headers; collapsed
  to a single-line command
- **Critical:** Heredoc EOF error in `raptor-performance.sh` — `cat << 'CONF'` block
  containing single quotes in `ExecStart=` caused the shell to never find the closing
  delimiter; fixed by switching to unquoted `<< CONF` with `\$` escaping for the
  affected block
- **Critical:** `raptor-performance.sh` file truncation during copy — script was being
  cut off mid-line at the Firefox prefs block, causing `unexpected EOF` errors at
  build time
- **zram Compression** status in Raptor RAM Optimizer incorrectly reported "zram not
  active" despite zram being correctly configured and mounted — fixed detection to
  read `/sys/block/zram0/disksize` for existence check and distinguish between idle
  (nothing swapped yet) and truly inactive
- **zram sizing** in `raptor-performance.sh` was evaluated at image build time using
  the build container's RAM rather than the end user's hardware — noted as a known
  limitation pending a runtime firstboot service fix

### Changed
- Raptor Update Manager fully rewritten — previous version silently crashed on launch
  due to missing `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` in the wrapper launcher; new version adds
  automatic update check on launch, live changelog loaded from GitHub, live log output
  during update, and automatic 10-second countdown reboot on success
- Update Manager flow now mirrors Windows Update: check → confirm → update → reboot
  with cancellable countdown

## [v2.2] - 2026-05-07 (Major Fix)

### Fixed
- **Critical:** `vm.overcommit_memory` corrected from mode 1 (always overcommit) to mode 0
  (heuristic) — mode 1 allowed Unity/Unturned to silently allocate past physical RAM,
  causing hard crashes at the RAM ceiling
- **Critical:** Conflicting `vm.swappiness` values between `raptor-memory.conf` and
  `raptor-gaming.conf` resolved — duplicate entries caused unpredictable boot-order
  races; swappiness is now owned exclusively by `raptor-memory.conf`
- `vm.swappiness` raised from 60 to 80 — zram is in-RAM compressed swap (~10× faster
  than disk), so a higher swappiness aggressively compresses cold pages instead of
  triggering the OOM killer on spikes
- `vm.page-cluster` set to 0 — default value of 3 caused 8-page read-ahead on every
  zram fault, wasting memory and adding latency on compressed swap
- `vm.min_free_kbytes` raised from 64 MB to 128 MB to prevent page allocator stalls
  under heavy RAM pressure
- `vm.watermark_scale_factor` raised from 125 to 200 so the kernel begins reclaiming
  pages earlier, before hitting the RAM ceiling
